          <h2>what is Football?</h2>
         <p> Soccer, also known as “association football” or "football," is a popular sport in many countries. In 1848, the first ever soccer game was played in London. The soccer ball is round and made of an inflated rubber. The pitch has two lines on it that divide the field into halves with either end containing a goal post or "goal mouth." Players can use any part of their body to touch the ball with the exception of their hands or arms. 

          The best player in the world is undoubtedly Lionel Messi. 22-year-old Messi won the FIFA World Player of the Year for four straight years, from 2009 to 2012 in a row and he holds five Ballon D’or titles in his career. He is also considered among the greatest players of all time, having won an astonishing 30 trophies and scoring more goals than any other player in history 

          Despite being one of the most decorated players in soccer history, Messi acknowledges that there's still a lot of improvement potential left for him at this age.
